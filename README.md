# PROJECTS
## Sports Bracket Generator 

This project accomplishes the goal of being able to create tournaments and tourneys within each tournament.
To create the layout and frontend portion of the website, we utilized HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a templating library called Handlebars.
For the backend portion of the website we utilized MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js.
